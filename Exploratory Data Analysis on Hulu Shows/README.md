This is a project for Exploratory Data Analysis on Top 1000 Hulu Shows. It is done to know which shows are most popular shows on Hulu, what type of shows are there, what genre people like the most etc.
With so many subscriptions available now-a-days, a person can get confused which subscription to go for. This analysis can be helpful in deciding whether one should take the Hulu subscription or not based on their preference.

For this project, I have done the following things-
- Cleaned the data
- Checked for null values
- Filled in missing values
- Sanity Check
- Created plots for various columns to do EDA on Hulu Shows
