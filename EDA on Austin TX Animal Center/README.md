This is a project for Exploratory Data Analysis on Austin TX Animal Center. It is done to know about intakes and outcomes of the Texas shelter from Oct, 1 2013 to September, 21 2016. 
Here I am trying to understand which animals are in the shelter, what were their conditions while intake and outcome, their reasons for being there etc.
Here we have 2 datasets, 1 has intake data and another has outcomes data.

Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes:
Animal Center Intakes from Oct, 1st 2013 to September, 21 2016. Intakes represent animals brought to the center by citizens or Animal Services staff. Animals may be brought to the center as lost, injured or for the purpose of adoption. Animals may also be brought to the center as Public Assist. All animals receive a unique Animal ID during intake.

Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes:
Animal Center Outcomes from Oct, 1st 2013 to September, 21 2016. Outcomes represent the status of animals as they leave the Animal Center. All animals receive a unique Animal ID during intake. Annually over 90% of animals entering the center, are adopted, transferred to rescue or returned to their owners. The Outcomes data set reflects that Austin, TX. is the largest "No Kill" city in the country.

For this project, I have done the following things-

- Cleaned the datasets
- Combined the 2 datasets
- Checked for null values
- Filled in missing values
- Sanity Check
- Created plots for various columns to do EDA on Austin Texas Animal Shelter dataset
